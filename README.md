# Thesis---Honeypot-ELK-Query-Scripts
These Python scripts were developed as part of my Thesis research to evaluate attacker behavior across multiple web application honeypot systems.
Each honeypot was stood up using T-Pot, and each of these scripts pulls from the ElasticSearch logs and visualizes or analyzes attacker activity, flow behavior, alert diversity, and more.

> Note: You must supply your own Elasticsearch credentials. These scripts should work for any T-Pot instance given the proper IP addresses
